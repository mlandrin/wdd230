                <div class="cntr"><a href="https://www.apple.com/?afid=p238%7CseIEs444j-dc_mtid_1870765e38482_pcrid_592988481760_pgrid_13945964887_pntwk_g_pchan__pexid__&cid=aos-us-kwgo-brand-apple--slid---product-">https://www.apple.com/</a></div>           
                <img src="../images/1whitespace.jpg" alt="Apple">
                <p>One of the strengths of Apple's website is their simplicity. They maintain the integrity of their products by allowing them to shine without the need of a colorful background or complex design. Intesad, Apple uses whitespace to let the products speak for themselves.</p>

                <img src="../images/1visual.jpg" alt="Pizza Hut">
                <p>Visual Heirarchy suggests that the website has items on their page shown with the most important things at the top. This is done to make it easy for users to find and navigate the website. Pizza hut places items such as their menu and cart at the top menu to provide users with an easy experience.</p>

                <img src="../images/1alignment.jpg" alt="Target">
                <p>An essential part to a successful web page is a cohesive theme. In the example of Target, they have updated their colors and style to revolve around their theme for Mother's Day. Target updates their website to reflect holidays and the products they are trying to highlight. This makes their website visually appealing no matter what time of the year it is.</p>
